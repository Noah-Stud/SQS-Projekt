# 1. Introduction and Goals
## 1.1 Overview for SQS-Chat-App
This system is a lightweight chat app, similar to services like Twitter or Mastodon.
It is designed to allow users to post messages in a news feed, like other people's messages, and comment on them. 
A distinction is made between logged-in and anonymous users: Users that are not logged in can only read the feed, while logged-in users can actively participate. 
The system also allows new users to register, which only requires an email-address.

The system is equipped with only the most essential features. 
It is not possible to delete messages and comments or edit their content (exapted by changing them directly in the database by using Third-Party Systems).

The requirement goals have been established for this system:

| Id | Requirement          | Description                                                                                                      |
|----|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| F1 | Registration         | New users can register using an unused email-address.                                                            |
| F2 | Login                | Registered users can login using their email-address and password.                                               |
| F3 | Newsfeed             | Users can read the Newsfeed, even if they are not logged in. The Newsfeed should be ordered by date of creation. |
| F4 | Creation of Message  | A user that is logged in can create a new Message.                                                               |
| F5 | Liking Messages      | A user that is logged in can like existing Messages.                                                             |
| F6 | Creation of Comments | A user that is logged in can leave a Comment under an existing Messages.                                         |

| Maintainability & Support | Maintenance (Database) | Should a change of database be necessary, it should be a easy as possible.                                                    |
| Maintainability & Support |       Deployment       | The deployment of the system must be as easy as possible (ideally only on command).                                           |
|         Security          |  User Authentication   | Actions the require an user-account (Create Message, Like Message, Comment) should only be possible if the user is logged in. |
