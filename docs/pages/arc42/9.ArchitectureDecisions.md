# 9. Architecture Decisions (ADRs)

## Choosing a framework for the frontend
### Context and Problem
It doesn't make sense to write all the backend code yourself, 
as there are many frameworks that can save you a lot of programming work without sacrificing quality or even improving it.

### Possible options
* No Framework (write everything yourself)
* SpringBoot
* Quarkus
* Open Liberty

### Decision
Chosen option: "SpringBoot" because it runs in Java, meets the requirements (support for REST, database queries, and security), 
and developers already have experience with this tool.

## Choosing a database system for persistence
### Context and Problem
How can the data (users, messages, comments) be permanently preserved (even when the application is restarted)?
It must be possible to access the data at any time and adjust it if necessary.

### Possible options
* H2
* MySql
* MongoDB

### Decision
The chosen option: "MySQL" because it meets the requirements for permanent data retention, 
is supported by Docker and SpringBoot, and developers already have experience with this tool.
No other tool meets all these requirements.

## Choosing a framework for the frontend
### Context and Problem
It doesn't make sense to write all the frontend code yourself, 
as there are many frameworks that can save you a lot of programming work without sacrificing quality or even improving it.

### Possible options
* No Framework (write everything yourself)
* React
* Angular

### Decision
Chosen option: "React" because it can be used with TypeScript, meets the requirements (REST support), 
developers already have some experience with this tool, and many project-relevant examples and tutorials exist.
