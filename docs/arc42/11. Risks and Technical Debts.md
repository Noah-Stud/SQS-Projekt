# 11. Risks and Technical Debts
Remark: In this small project I donâ€™t see any real risks for architecture and implementation. 
Therefore, the risks shown below are probably a bit artificial.

## 11.1 Technical risks
| Risk                                                                     | Description                                                                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Quote-API may not be available in the future                             | The Quote-API is a 3rd-Party-System, wherefore access could be lost in the future.                                 |
| System relies on Docker - which may not be available on target computers | Although Docker is installed on many systems (especially servers), it might not be available on the target system. |


## 11.2 Business or domain risks

| Risk                     | Description                                                           |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| System might be obsolete | Many alternatives with more capabilities already exist on the market. |
